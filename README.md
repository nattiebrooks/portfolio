# Portfolio

The goal of this portfolio is to showcase my JavaScript and Web Development skills. I intend to develop a site
that will not only introduce me, but also display my skills as a developer. Initially  I will work on front-end technologies: HTML/CSS/JS, utilizing Sass and the MERN stack. 

Additionally, I have some interest in game development and may created some html 5 games and/or use Kaboom.js to develop games. As of now, this will be secondary to developing and displaying my Full-stack skills.
